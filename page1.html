    <p>About Us</p>
    <p>Founded in Summer 2022 at Turtle Rock Community Park, Turtle Rock Science Club(TRSC) was started as an extracurricular activity for science enthusiasts from the local elementary school. Initially organized by parent volunteers, TRSC aimed to foster a love for science through hands-on experiments and activities. Over the last two years, the club has significantly expanded, and is now led by former Turtle Rock students, with old TRSC members coming back to help out and give back to the community. In the future, TRSC plans to expand our audience to more than just Turtle Rock students, along with hosting more workshops and meetings.</p>
